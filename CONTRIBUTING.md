# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests (PRs)
Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Here are some guidelines to help ensure that your PR is smoothly
processed:

1. **Focused/Reviewable**:
   Each PR should address a single issue or add a single feature. PRs are easiest to review when they are small,
   incremental changes. Focus helps our review process and the clarity of the project's history.
   * Before significant work, please open an issue to discuss your plans. We may need to provide specific guidance
      regarding the direction of our project.

2. **Well-Tested**:
   Ensure that your code is thoroughly tested to prevent bugs and regressions. Include unit, integration, and/or
   end-to-end tests whenever possible. New and/or existing tests should demonstrate the correctness of your changes.
   Execute as many of the tests as you are able, prior to PR submission.

3. **Code Quality**:
   Submit clean, readable, and efficient code. Follow the existing project structure, naming conventions, and other
   established patterns within the codebase. See our [Style Guide](STYLE.md).
   * For clarity, avoid reformatting code outside the section of code you are changing.

4. **Descriptive Titles and Messages**:
   Use descriptive and concise titles. Include a detailed message describing what the PR does, the problem it solves,
   and any related issues or discussions.

5. **Documentation**:
   Update the documentation and/or comments to reflect your changes, especially if you are introducing new or changing
   existing behavior.

6. **Up-to-Date**:
   Ensure your PR is up-to-date with the main branch to prevent merge conflicts. Rebase and resolve conflicts if
   necessary when submitting.

7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   AWS-LC supports a variety of operating systems and environments. Avoid changes that might break our cross-platform
   compatibility.

The above guidelines help clarify our expectations for PRs we accept for merging, but it's OK to make a mistake!
We know that most PRs submitted will not be perfect. Our team will review each PR and provide specific feedback
regarding concerns we identify. We appreciate any effort from our community that helps us improve AWS-LC!

[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Finding contributions to work on
Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.
