            ### Issues:
            Automated check detected that some third-party test vectors in `third_party/vectors` need to be updated.

            ### Next Steps
            - Run `cd third_party/vectors && python3 ./sync.py` locally to update vectors
            - Review any new test vectors that are added
            - Run `ninja -C build crypto_test` to ensure all tests pass
            - Run `python3 util/generate_build_files.py` to update build files
            - Verify `cd third_party/vectors && python3 ./sync.py --check` returns success
