.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I jitterentropy
library provides a source of good entropy by collecting CPU
executing time jitter. The entropy in the CPU execution time
jitter is magnified by the CPU Jitter Random Number Generator.
The CPU Jitter Random Number Generator uses the CPU execution
timing jitter to generate a bit stream which complies with
different statistical measurements that determine the bit
stream is random.
.LP
The CPU Jitter Random Number Generator delivers entropy which
follows information theoretical requirements. Based on these
studies and the implementation, the caller can assume that
one bit of data extracted from the CPU Jitter Random Number
Generator holds one bit of entropy.
.LP
The CPU Jitter Random Number Generator provides a decentralized
source of entropy where the caller does not need to rely
on a centrally maintained source of entropy like
.IR /dev/random
or
.IR /dev/urandom .
.LP
.BR jent_entropy_switch_notime_impl ()
allows the caller to set a thread handler that is used by the
Jitter RNG if it operates in the timer-less mode. See
.IR jitterentropy.h
for a documentation of
.IR new_thread .
This function must be called before
.BR jent_entropy_init ()
as after this call, the change of the thread handler is denied.
.LP
.BR jent_set_fips_failure_callback ()
allows the caller to set a callback that is invoked by the
Jitter RNG when a health test failure is detected. The callback
specified with the parameter
.BR cb
to the API function receives the Jitter RNG state with the parameter
.BR ec
and the FIPS health test failure with the parameter
.BR health_failure .
his function must be called before
.BR jent_entropy_init ()
as after this call, the change of the callback is denied.
.LP
.BR jent_entropy_init ()
initializes the CPU Jitter Random Number Generator. The function
performs statistical tests to verify that the underlying system
offers the properties needed for measuring and collecting entropy.
If the initialization is successful, which implies that the
statistical tests indicate the underlying system is appropriate,
the call returns with
.IR 0 .
A return code other than
.IR 0
indicates a failure where the calling application
.B MUST NOT
use the CPU Jitter Random Number Generator.
.LP
.BR jent_entropy_init_ex ()
behaves identically to
.BR jent_entropy_init ()
except that it allows the caller to provide the
.IR osr
and
.IR flags
parameters which should be identical to the subsequent invocation of
.BR jent_entropy_collector_alloc ().
When specifying an oversampling rate
.IR osr
different than the default, the startup test honor this value and adjust
the self-test cut-off thresholds to the same values as used at runtime.
.LP
.BR jent_entropy_collector_alloc ()
allocates a CPU Jitter entropy collector instance and returns the handle
to the caller. If the allocation fails, including memory
constraints, the call returns
.IR NULL .
The function requires two arguments, the oversampling rate
.IR osr
and a set of flags with
.IR flags .
The
.IR osr
value defines the amount of oversampling performed by the entropy
collector. Usually, a caller wants to provide the value 0 here to
apply the default oversampling. The call ensures that any value
lower than
.B JENT_MIN_OSR
is converted to
.B JENT_MIN_OSR
automatically.
.LP
The
.IR flags
value is either zero or one or more of the following flags.
.TP
.B JENT_DISABLE_MEMORY_ACCESS
If the system is constrained with memory, this flag
disables the allocation of that memory and therefore memory accesses. But
that also implies that the entropy collection process only relies on the
complexity of the CPU. Note, if somebody knows all details of that CPU
complexity, that person may potentially reduce the entropy delivered by the CPU
complexity. If that person can push the generated entropy below a threshold,
the CPU Jitter random number generator starts overestimating entropy from the
noise source. Thus, disabling memory accesses and relying only on the CPU
complexity should only be done if you really know what you are doing.
.TP
.B JENT_FORCE_INTERNAL_TIMER
This flag can be used to force the Jitter RNG to use the internal
high-resolution timer instead of using the hardware time stamp. Commonly,
the startup self test performed with
.BR jent_entropy_init ()
uses the hardware timer with precedence if it is identified to be appropriate
for entropy collection. If the internal timer is not compiled, requesting
this flag returns an error. Even though a separate thread is spawned
to provide a high-resolution time stamp, this entire operation is completely
thread-safe as all relevant data is maintained as part of the
.IR entropy_collector
data structure.
.TP
.B JENT_DISABLE_INTERNAL_TIMER
This flag can be used to ensure that the internal timer is not used.
If this flag is used together with
.B JENT_FORCE_INTERNAL_TIMER
this is treated as an error and the allocation returns NULL. Also,
in case
.BR jent_entropy_init ()
detects that the internal timer shall be used but the disable flag
is set, the allocation returns NULL.
.TP
.B JENT_FORCE_FIPS
Force full FIPS 140 and SP800-90B compliance irrespective of the
FIPS setting of the underlying operating system.
.TP
.B JENT_MAX_MEMSIZE_*
Define the maximum amount of memory that the Jitter RNG will use
for its operation supporting the collection of raw noise. Without
using one of these flags, the Jitter RNG uses a built-in limit.
The larger the amount of memory is the more entropy is collected.
Yet, the default value is safe on most CPUs. If you have memory
pressure but the entropy rate of your CPU is sufficient a lower
memory size may be used. Contrary when having sufficient memory
but insufficient entropy, larger memory sizes may be specified.
In any case, the Jitter RNG uses at most as much memory as the
sum of the CPU's data caches.
.LP
.BR jent_entropy_collector_free()
zeroizes and frees the given CPU Jitter entropy collector instance.
.LP
.BR jent_read_entropy ()
generates a random bit stream and returns it to the caller.
.IR entropy_collector
is the CPU Jitter entropy collector instance which shall be used
to obtain random numbers.
.IR data
is the destination memory location where the random bit stream
is written to. The memory must have already been allocated by the
caller.
.IR len
is a length value provided by the caller indicating the number
of bytes the CPU Jitter Random Number Generator shall generate.
The caller can provide any value greater than 0. The caller
must ensure that
.IR data
is at least als big as
.IR len
indicates. The function returns the number of bytes generated
when the request is successfully completed. If the function returns
the error code
.IR -1
then the caller handed in a non-initialized (i.e. NULL value)
for the entropy collector. The return code of
.IR -2
indicates the SP800-90B repetition count online health test failed.
The error code of
.IR -3
specifies that the SP800-90B adaptive proportion online health test
failed.
.IR -4
marks that the internal timer generator cannot be initialized.
.IR -5
specifies that the LAG predictor health test failed.
.IR -6
indicates that the Repetitive Count Test (RCT) failed permanently.
.IR -7
indicates that the Adaptive Proportion Test (APT) failed permanently.
.IR -8
indicates that the LAG prediction test failed permanently.
.LP
When either online health test fails the Jitter RNG will not
have any data provided in
.IR data .
The entropy collector instance will remain in error state. To recover,
the entropy collector instance
.B MUST
be deallocated and a fresh instance must be allocated. It is
recommended that you increase the
.IR osr
value at least by one when newly allocating the Jitter RNG with
.BR jent_entropy_collector_alloc ()
which implies that the health tests are less sensitive due to the
fact that the assumed entropy rate of the noise source is lower.
.LP
.BR jent_read_entropy_safe ()
is a service function to and therefore operates identically to
.BR jent_read_entropy ()
with the exception that it automatically re-allocates the entropy collector
if a health test failure is observed. Before reallocation, a
new power-on health test is performed. The allocation of the new entropy
collector automatically increases the OSR by one. This is done based
on the idea that a health test failure indicates that the assumed
entropy rate is too high.
.LP
Note the function returns with an health test error if the OSR is
getting too large. If an error is returned by this function, the Jitter
RNG is not safe to be used on the current system.
.LP
The function
.BR jent_read_entropy_safe ()
has the same error codes as
.BR jent_read_entropy ().
.LP
.BR JENT_MAJVERSION
indicates API / ABI incompatible changes, functional changes that require
consumer to be updated.
.LP
.BR JENT_MINVERSION
indicates API compatible, ABI may change, functional enhancements only,
consumer can be left unchanged if enhancements are not considered.
.LP
.BR JENT_PATCHLEVEL
indicates API / ABI compatible, no functional changes, no enhancements, bug
fixes only. Also, the entropy collection is not changed in any way that
would necessitate a re-assessment.
.LP
.BR JENT_VERSION
the version number of the library as an integer value that is monotonically
increasing. The version numbers are multiples of 100. For example, version
1.2.3 is converted to 1020300 -- the last two digits are reserved for
future use.
.LP
.BR jent_version ()
returns
.BR JENT_VERSION.
.PP
.SH FIPS 140-3 Considerations
In order for the Jitter RNG to execute compliant to FIPS 140-3 and by
extension also SP800-90B and SP800-90C compliant, the following
considerations must be applied:
.TP
.B Enable FIPS mode
The FIPS mode is enabled by using the
.IR JENT_FORCE_FIPS
flag during initialization of the Jitter RNG library. On Linux, the
the FIPS mode is transparently enabled if the entire operating system
was booted in FIPS mode, usually by using the "fips=1" Linux kernel
command line parameter.
.TP
.B Perform heursitic entropy analysis
The test tool set provided as part of the Jitter RNG library source
distribution contains the helper to obtain raw noise data at runtime
as well as at initialization time to calculate the SP800-90B entropy rate.
This rate must be above 0.333, the implied heuristic minimum by the Jitter
RNG library.
.TP
.B Resolve insufficient entropy
If insufficient entropy is found during the aforementioned SP800-90B
analysis, the test tool set provides a helper to analyze optimal
settings - see the test tool set for raw entropy for details. The resulting
configuration values are expected to be used with the
.IR flags
parameter of the calls
.BR jent_entropy_collector_alloc ()
and
.BR jent_entropy_init_ex () .
It is recommended that the function
.BR jent_read_entropy_safe ()
API call is used for generating random numbers.
.PP
.SH NOTES
In addition to use the generated random bit stream directly
for cryptographic operations, the output of
.BR jent_read_entropy ()
can be used for seeding a deterministic random number generator.
