 * Disable the loop shuffle operation
 *
 * The shuffle operation enlarges the timing of the conditioning function
 * by a variable length defined by the LSB of a time stamp. Some mathematicians
 * are concerned that this pseudo-random selection of the loop iteration count
 * may create some form of dependency between the different loop counts
 * and the associated time duration of the conditioning function. It
 * also complicates entropy assessment because it effectively combines a bunch
 * of shifted/scaled copies the same distribution and masks failures from the
 * health testing.
 *
 * By enabling this flag, the loop shuffle operation is disabled and
 * the entropy collection operates in a way that honor the concerns.
 *
 * By enabling this flag, the time of collecting entropy may be enlarged.

 * provided by NIST, but further analysis
 * (https://www.untruth.org/~josh/sp80090b/CMUF%20EWG%20Draft%20IG%20D.K%20Comments%20D10.pdf)

 * test with both a higher false positive rate (because multiple raw symbols
 * map to the same symbol within the health test) and a lower statistical power
 * when the APT cutoff is selected based on the apparent truncated entropy
 * (i.e., truncation generally makes the test worse). NIST has since withdrawn
 * this draft and stated that they will not propose truncation prior to
 * health testing.
 * Because the general tendency of such truncation to make the health test
 * worse the default value is set such that no data is masked out and this
 * should only be changed if a hardware-specific analysis suggests that some
 * other mask setting is beneficial.
 * The mask is applied to a time stamp where the GCD is already divided out, and thus no

 * Function pointer data structure to register an external thread handler
 * used for the timer-less mode of the Jitter RNG.
 *
 * The external caller provides these function pointers to handle the
 * management of the timer thread that is spawned by the Jitter RNG.
 *
 * @var jent_notime_init This function is intended to initialize the threading
 *	support. All data that is required by the threading code must be
 *	held in the data structure @param ctx. The Jitter RNG maintains the
 *	data structure and uses it for every invocation of the following calls.
 *
 * @var jent_notime_fini This function shall terminate the threading support.
 *	The function must dispose of all memory and resources used for the
 *	threading operation. It must also dispose of the @param ctx memory.
 *
 * @var jent_notime_start This function is called when the Jitter RNG wants
 *	to start a thread. Besides providing a pointer to the @param ctx
 *	allocated during initialization time, the Jitter RNG provides a
 *	pointer to the function the thread shall execute and the argument
 *	the function shall be invoked with. These two parameters have the
 *	same purpose as the trailing two parameters of pthread_create(3).
 *
 * @var jent_notime_stop This function is invoked by the Jitter RNG when the
 *	thread should be stopped. Note, the Jitter RNG intends to start/stop
 *	the thread frequently.
 *
 * An example implementation is found in the Jitter RNG itself with its
 * default thread handler of jent_notime_thread_builtin.
 *
 * If the caller wants to register its own thread handler, it must be done
 * with the API call jent_entropy_switch_notime_impl as the first
 * call to interact with the Jitter RNG, even before jent_entropy_init.
 * After jent_entropy_init is called, changing of the threading implementation
 * is not allowed.
